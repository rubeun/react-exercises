# MyReads Project


MyReads is @udacity first React Nanodegree Project. In the MyReads project, there are three bookshelves for books: currently reading, read, and want to read. User can move books between those shelves and search new books. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.
