# Rubeun's Reading Bookshelf React Website

Reading Bookshelf React App consist of 3 bookshelves. 

* Top Shelf: Books I'm currently reading
* Middle Shelf: Books I want to read
* Bottom Shelf: Books I've already read
* Not on a Shelf: Books that are not on the shelf that you can find using search

Search for books to add to a shelf by clicking on the button on the bottom right or adding /search to the URL.
Books matching either the title or the author will be displayed dynamically underneath the search bar.
